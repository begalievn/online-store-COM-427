## Idea of the project
The idea is to inform student of Ala-Too university about our dining hall. 
- We have questions before taking some meal:
- What type of meal we have?
- What we can have for dessert?
- What salad we have?
- How much it costs?

So "Столовка" intended to answer for these questions.
